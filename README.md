# Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk Using Patient Social Determinants of Health

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for hospital readmission risk using patient social determinants of health (SDOH) data.  The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high risk of readmission, allowing healthcare providers to implement proactive interventions and optimize resource allocation. This ultimately contributes to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.  The model utilizes various statistical and machine learning methods to identify significant SDOH factors and build a robust predictive model.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key statistical summaries and model performance metrics to the console.  Additionally, visualizations such as bar charts illustrating the impact of various SDOH factors on readmission risk and potentially a ROC curve showing model performance will be saved as PNG files in the `output` directory (e.g., `readmission_risk_by_factor.png`, `roc_curve.png`).  The specific output may vary depending on the chosen model and analysis performed.

**Data:**

(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.  Mention if the data is publicly available or requires access restrictions.)

**Future Work:**

(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project, such as exploring different machine learning algorithms, incorporating additional SDOH factors, or developing a user interface.)

**Contributing:**

(Optional: Add a section outlining contribution guidelines if you intend for others to contribute to the project.)
